## 1. About
This API powers a platform that generates rich, interactive stories for kids based on user prompts. The API automates the entire storytelling process, handling everything from text generation to multimedia creation.

## 2. Live Demo
You can see how illustrations can be re-colored at the [**Live Demo**](https://nq-portfolio.com/recoloring/demo).

## 3. Core Components

### 1. Story API Endpoint
  - **NoSQL CRUD operations**: Stores and retrieves stories, supports user engagement (reading, liking, tracking interactions), and fetches stories based on subscription plans (Free/Premium).
  - **Illustrations**: Generates 10â€“20 AI-generated images for each story.
  - **Text-to-Speech**: Two distinct voice options generate audio files for narration.
  - **3D Collectibles**: Each story includes a unique, animated 3D asset in mesh and GIF format.

### 2. GIF Processing
  - Converts images into GIF format.
  - Removes the background from GIFs.
  - Watermarks GIFs with a logo (similar to TikTok).

### 3. Image Processing
  - Modifies the color of story illustrations to fit themes or user preferences.

### 4. Audio Processing
  - Merges multiple audio segments into a single file.
  - Generates text-to-speech audio for seamless narration.

## 4. Libraries (NPM)
